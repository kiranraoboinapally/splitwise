Assignment – Build a Splitwise Clone
Neurix Full-Stack SDE Intern – Application Assignment
Thanks for your interest in Neurix! We’d love to see how you think creatively and apply your coding skills. This is a short, simple assignment — no overthinking needed.

Core Requirements
Splitwise helps people track shared expenses and figure out who owes whom. For this assignment, you’ll create a simplified version that includes groups, expense splitting (equal or percentage), and balance tracking. 
Backend (Python + FastAPI + PostgreSQL) 
Group Management
POST /groups: Create a new group with a name and list of user IDs.
GET /groups/{group_id}: Get group details (name, users, total expenses).


Expense Management
POST /groups/{group_id}/expenses: Add a new expense to a group.
Input: description, amount, paid_by (user_id), split_type (equal or percentage), splits.
Support two split types:
Equal: Split equally among group members.
Percentage: Split based on percentages provided for each member.


Balance Tracking
GET /groups/{group_id}/balances: See who owes whom in the group.
GET /users/{user_id}/balances: See all balances for a particular user across groups.
Notes:
No need for authentication/authorization
No payment/settlement functionality
Use PostgreSQL for persistence
Use SQLAlchemy or any ORM of your choice


Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)
Build a simple UI to:
Create a group with users.
Add an expense to a group.
View group balances (who owes whom).
View personal balance summary.
The UI should call your REST APIs and present the data cleanly with TailwindCSS.

Bonus (Optional): LLM-Powered Chatbot
Add an AI chatbot to your frontend that can answer natural language queries like:
“How much does Alice owe in group Goa Trip?”
“Show me my latest 3 expenses.”
“Who paid the most in Weekend Trip?”
Implementation Tips:

Use OpenAI or HuggingFace API.
Send user query + structured context from your DB to the LLM.
Return clean, formatted answers to the user in the chat UI.



Deliverables:

backend/ (FastAPI app)
frontend/ (React app)
docker-compose.yml for full stack setup
README.md with:
Setup and run instructions with simple command
API documentation (OpenAPI or manually listed endpoints)
Any assumptions made
